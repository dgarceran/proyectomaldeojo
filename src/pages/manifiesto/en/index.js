	    	<Languages />
		    <p>It seems like in recent years a large number of small and vital resistances are occurring all over the world, each showing its diversity and articulation values. At the same time, a new and powerful right-wing resurgence makes us ring the alarm for the future of our society and the damage that this toxic movement may incur. </p>
		    <p>The capitalist system may come to dominate the spaces we share. Subtlety ends up drowning out more diverse or insightful opinions by perpetrating rigid rules on how we should carry out our practices. The pertinent questions are multiple, such as what degree of intervention is needed, or what responsibility is necessary to ensure autonomous and sustainable anti-authoritarian practices. </p>
		    <p>Alluded poetically as this metaphysical and abstract force, Mal de Ojo is the mystical condition alluded to when we become capable of unfolding the edges of the Orb so that the reflections of this world also suffer with what we feel in our midst.</p>
		    <p>"Eye" (Ojo) is perhaps the word that has been bequeathed to us intact through which it is still possible to glimpse the principle of life itself. The eye, when it approaches the gaze, destroys, reconstructs or gives life to the images that appear. In our head, we can recreate what we see. In an uncontrollable blink, what we see offers us a handful of distorted information; wall and street foreshortenings that resume an obtuse spirituality under a blind light that comes from the sun, or in the absence of it.</p>
		    <p>The ability to interfere in the routine visual field and to see in the invisible is more than extraordinary. To claim through the image the cracks of humanity - the little we have left - is a task for the brave ones. Understanding this world has never been and will never be a task to be disengaged without courage. For those devoted to registering the movements of our lives, it has a vital courage value that unfortunately escapes our recognition.</p>
		    <p>By compiling the work by photographers all over the world, the results can be unexpected, and what we want is to find this surprise. We want to be able to identify the movements that are recorded behind the routine field of vision and to materialize it in the form of social research. </p>
		    <p>The result will be a publication followed by an exhibition reflecting the many voices around this world and connecting them. Our idea is to make it be seen, to make it move and to aim at the enemy in an objective and enunciative way. To denounce generalized fascism through photography and to show the movements that fight against it.</p>
		    <h3>Objectives</h3>
		    <p>Through photography, this project conjugates the transcendent will to expose visibly the intimacy of a hidden hustle and bustle from existing resistances all over the world. From the squatting movement to the LGTBI struggle, from punk or trap projects, from powerful resistances against gentrification or what is traditionally called the anti-fascist movement; we want to register what each of these movements have in common and how the differences in their political articulation, as it is, for instance, a European perspective and a South American perspective (just to name a few), can be reflected in photography and how it can be used as political objects. Accordingly, photography will serve as a reminder, as a memoir of current organized and dissident political groups, and a reaffirmation effort of who we are, when we seem to run out of breath. </p>
		    <p>This project emerges with the urgency of firmly "self-approaching," of vindicating the life that has been taken from us and reclaiming ourselves in what we call the present. The urgency glimpsed in the eyes of photographers around the world is the undaunted affirmation that we still have the will to look at how we can act against the enemy.</p>
		    <p>We want to extract from this project an understanding of the practices from dissident movements against the capitalist system, so we can unfold the repressive practices that push us to live. We want to make these movements see, give them prestige and protagonism. Throughout the research process, we want to cluster each of the identified resistances and connect them, to understand where we are going and how we are currently moving forward.</p>
